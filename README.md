# Banking System in Java

A console-based Java application that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance checking, and fund transfer. The project is developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage accounts and transactions effectively.

## 💡 Overview

This banking system is designed for beginners who want to understand how real-world banking functionality can be implemented in Java using classes and objects.

## 🚀 Features

- Account Creation
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Check Account Balance
- Transfer Funds Between Accounts
- Input validation and basic exception handling
- Console-based interactive interface

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Design

- **Account Class** – stores account number, holder name, balance
- **Bank Class** – manages list of accounts and transactions
- **Main Class** – handles user input and interaction

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java)
- OOP (Encapsulation, Classes, Objects)
- Scanner class for input
- Collections (ArrayList or HashMap)
- Exception Handling
